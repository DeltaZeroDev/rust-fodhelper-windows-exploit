# rust-fodhelper-windows-exploit
Rust code for the windows fodhelper exploit that grants an executable admin permissions

THIS IS ILLEGAL TO USE MALICIOUSLY, PLEASE DO NOT USE MALICIOUSLY. IF YOU RUN THIS, IT WILL LAG YOUR PC AND GAIN ADMIN PERMS ON A CMD, NOTHING ELSE

I'm not responsible for any damage caused by this. It was just a project done by me and I am not to blame for what others use it for.
